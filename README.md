# Realtime-Code-Editor
A real-time code editor is a tool that allows developers to write, edit, and test their code in a live environment. These editors typically provide features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and error checking, and they often have built-in preview functionality to see how the code will look or behave in real-time.
